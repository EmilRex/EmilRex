### Hi, I'm [@EmilRex](https://github.com/EmilRex) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data engineer living and working in NYC ðŸ—½

I started coding and working with data in college and have been learning ever since. I spent my formative years at [enigma](https://enigma.com/) collecting _all the data_ for fun and profit.

These days I'm the singleton data engineer at [care/of](https://takecareof.com/) where I write SQL, build pipelines, manage infrastructure, and everything in between.
