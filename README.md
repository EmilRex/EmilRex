### Hi, I'm [@EmilRex](https://github.com/EmilRex) 👋

I'm a data engineer living and working in NYC 🗽

I started coding and working with data in college and have been learning ever since. I spent my formative years at [enigma](https://enigma.com/) collecting _all the data_ for fun and profit. After that I was the singleton data engineer at [care/of](https://takecareof.com/) where I wrote SQL, built pipelines, managed infrastructure, and everything in between.

These days I'm at [prefect](https://prefect.io/) where I'm (more or less) tech support to tech support's tech support.

I also have an empty blog, so there's that. One of these days I'll post something 🤷‍♂️
