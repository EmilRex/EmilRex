### Hi, I'm [@EmilRex](https://github.com/EmilRex) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data engineer turned solutions architect.

I started working with data in college and have been ever since. My formative years were spent at [enigma](https://enigma.com/) collecting _all the data_ for fun and profit. After that I was the singleton data engineer at [care/of](https://takecareof.com/) (RIP ðŸª¦) where I wrote SQL, built pipelines, managed infrastructure, and everything in between.

These days I'm at [prefect](https://prefect.io/) where I'm (more or less) tech support to tech support's tech support.
